## 1. CST method

The class shape function transformation (CST) method combines class functions and shape functions to describe an arbitrary geometry and can guarantee airfoil smoothness with comparatively fewer design variables. Usually, a sixth-order Bernstein polynomial is used as the shape function; i.e., seven CST parameters are used to describe upper and lower surfaces.

```python
from cst_modeling.foil import cst_curve
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt

n_cst = 7
plt.figure()

for i in range(n_cst):
    cst = np.zeros(n_cst)
    cst[i] = 1.0
    x, y = cst_curve(101, cst)
    plt.plot(x, y)

plt.show()
```

The airfoil upper and lower surfaces are the **linear combinations** of these shape functions.



## 2. Airfoil

### 2.1 clean airfoils

Build a clean airfoil with given CST coefficients.

```python
import numpy as np
from cst_modeling.foil import cst_foil

cst_u = np.array([ 0.1185,  0.1189,  0.1557,  0.1367,  0.2092,  0.1483,  0.1935])
cst_l = np.array([-0.1155, -0.1341, -0.1091, -0.2532, -0.0122, -0.1184,  0.0641])
x, yu, yl, t0, R0 = cst_foil(1001, cst_u, cst_l, x=None, t=None, tail=0.0)

plt.figure()
plt.plot(x, yu, 'b')
plt.plot(x, yl, 'b')
plt.show()
```

</div>

Settings of this function:

```text
nn:     total amount of points on the upper/lower surfaces
x:      ndarray [nn]. If given, the points on the airfoil are placed by the given x.
t:      float. If given, the airfoil is scaled to have the given relative maximum thickness
tail:   float. If given, the airfoil is stretched to have the given relative tail thickness
        Meanwhile, the relative maximum thickness is kept unchanged if t is specified.
        Otherwise, the thickness will increase, when the tail is added.
```

### 2.2 CST coefficients of certain airfoil

Find the CST coefficients of a given airfoil by least square method.

This function allows the airfoil has non-zero tail thickness.

Also allows the airfoil chord length not equals to one.

```pytho
from cst_modeling.foil import cst_foil_fit
cst_u, cst_l = cst_foil_fit(x, yu, x, yl, n_order=n_cst)
# The cst_u, cst_l are ndarrays [n_cst]
```



### 2.3 output airfoils

Output the curves of airfoil upper and lower surfaces in Tecplot format.

```python
from cst_modeling.foil import output_foil
output_foil(x, yu, yl, fname='airfoil.dat', ID=0, info=False)
```

Settings of this function:

```text
fname:  otuput file name
ID:     ID of this airfoil, also the zone name
        When ID = 0, outputs the file header
info:   if True, then outputs the curvature, thickness and camber distribution
```



### 2.4 airfoil modification

Add bump function to the airfoil.

```python
from cst_modeling.foil import foil_bump_modify
xc = 0.7
h  = 0.02
s  = 0.6
yu_, yl_ = foil_bump_modify(x, yu, yl, xc, h, s, side=1)
```

Settings of this function:

```text
xc:         x location of the bump center
h:          bump height (can be either positive or negetive)
s:          bump width
side:       1/-1, modification to the upper/lower surface
n_order:    if specified (>0), then use CST to fit the new foil
```

    Fig. Bump modification to airfoil upper surface
</div>




### 2.5 airfoil increment

Add an incremental CST curve to the airfoil.

```python
from cst_modeling.foil import foil_increment
cst_u_ = np.zeros(16)
cst_l_ = np.zeros(16)
cst_u_[12] = 0.05
yu_, yl_ = foil_increment(x, yu, yl, cst_u_, cst_l_, t=t0)
```

Settings of this function:

```text
cst_u_:     CST coefficients of the incremental curve on the upper surface
cst_l_:     CST coefficients of the incremental curve on the lower surface
t:          optional float. If given, the airfoil relative maximum thickness is kept unchanged
```

<div align=center>

The green dash curve is the incremental CST curve.



## 3. Wing

The wing surface is a multi-section surface, which is defined by an object of **Surface** class. The **Surface** class contains several **Section** objects that define the control sections of the surface.

### 3.1 relevant class

#### Section

A class for control sections. The section 2D curves, i.e., the upper and lower surfaces, are generated by CST method. The 3D curve is transformed from the 2D curve, which starts from the lower surface trailing edge and ends at the upper surface trailing edge. The 3D curve is still a plane curve, the leading edge location, chord length, twist angle (deg), maximum relative thickness, relative tail thickness are defined by user. 

```python
from cst_modeling.foil import Section
sec = Section(thick=None, chord=1.0, twist=0.0, tail=0.0)
```

Parameters of this class:

```text
cst_u, cst_l:   ndarray, CST parameters
xLE, yLE, zLE:  leading edge coordinates (3D curve is in XY plane)
chord:          chord length of the section
twist:          twist angle (degree) of the chord line 
                (positive is defined by +Z direction with right hand rule)
tail:           relative tail thickness
thick:          relative maximum thickness (default None, means thickness not specified)

refine_u,refine_l:  ndarray, cst coefficients of upper and lower incremental curves
refine_fixed_t:     bool, whether fix thickness when adding incremental curves

flip_x:         if True, arrange xx and x in the reverse order
```

Attributes of this class: 

```text

xx, yu, yl: ndarray, coordinates of 2D upper and lower curve (uniform chord length)
x, y, z:    ndarray, coordinated of the 3D curve
```



#### Surface

A class for multi-section surfaces. The **Surface** class contains several **Section** objects that define the control sections of the surface.

```python
from cst_modeling.surface import Surface
wing = Surface(n_sec=3, name='Wing')
wing.read_setting('Wing.txt', tail=[0.1, 0.1, 0.1])
```

Orientation:

```text
+x:     flow direction (m)
+y:     upside (m)
+z:     spanwise (m)
twist:  +z direction (deg)
```

Parameters of this class:

```text

zLE_secs:   list of z cooridnates of section leading edges
half_s:     float, half span
center:     ndarray, center coordinates for better plot with matplotlib
```



### 3.2 simple wing

Build a simple wing 

```python
from cst_modeling.surface import Surface 
wing = Surface(n_sec=3, name='Wing-basic', nn=101, ns=21)
wing.read_setting('Wing.txt')
wing.geo()
wing.output_tecplot(fname='Wing-basic.dat')
```

The control file of the wing configuration and wing section geometry is 'Wing.txt'. The relevant settings are listed under the name of 'Wing-basic'.

```text

    1.0   1.0   1.0   1.0   1.0   1.0   1.0
   -1.0  -1.0  -1.0  -1.0  -1.0  -1.0  -1.0

    1.0   1.0   1.0   1.0   1.0   1.0   1.0
   -1.0  -1.0  -1.0  -1.0  -1.0  -1.0

```

Note:

* **[Surf]** is the flag for class **Surface** to locate the settings. It is followed by the name of the **Surface** object. There can be multiple **[Surf]** flags in one control file, e.g., 'Wing.txt'. Only the **[Surf]** followed by the same name (must be one string) is read.
* **Layout** is the flag that defines the configuration. The leading edge coordinates, chord length, twist angle, and maximum relative thickness of each control section are listed under **Layout**. Each line defines one control section.
* **CST_coefs** is the flag that defines the CST parameters of each control section. Each control section is defined with two lines that contains the CST parameters of the upper surface and lower surface, respectively. The number of CST parameters can be different in any line.
* **CST_refine** is the flag that defines the CST parameters of incremental curves for each control section. This part is optional, if not provided or *n_cst* is 0, this function is disabled. Otherwise, the upper and lower surface of each control section are added with an incremental curve defined with the following CST parameters. The incremental curves are implemented with **foil_increment** function in section 2.5. The *n_cst* is the number of CST parameters of the incremental curve, the *start-index* (starting from 0) is the index of the first CST parameter that is not zero. In other words, the following settings of the upper surface of the first control section means that the incremental curve is defined by 20 CST parameters. All the parameters are zero except for the two parameters *'0.1  0.1'* that starts from index 0, which means the CST parameters are [0.1, 0.1, 0.0, ...., 0.0].

```text
 ---------------------------------------------------
 CST_refine:
 ---------------------------------------------------
 n_cst   start-index
  20        0
 Section 1---------------
    0.1   0.1   
   -0.1  -0.1
 Section 2---------------

    0.0   0.0
 Section 3---------------

```

### 3.3 functions

Detailed settings can be found in the comments of each function.

#### geo_secs

Generate the surface sections.

```python
wing.geo_secs(showfoil=True, flip_x=False)
```

```text
showfoil:   if True, output name-foil.dat of airfoils
flip_x:     if True, flip section.xx in reverse order
```



#### geo

Generate the surface geometry.

```python
wing.geo(split=True, showfoil=True, flip_x=False, update_sec=True)
```

```text
showfoil:   if True, output name-foil.dat of airfoils
split:      if True, generate surfaces as upper and lower separately
flip_x:     if True, flip section.xx in reverse order
update_sec: if True, update control sections
```



#### add_sec

Add sections to the surface, the new sections are interpolated from current ones.

Must run before geo(), geo_secs() and flip(). This automatically updates the curves of all sections.

```python
wing.add_sec(location: list, axis='Z')
```

```text
location:   list of spanwise location (must within the range of current sections)
axis:       string 'Y' or 'Z', the direction for interplotation

```

#### flip

Rotate 90 degrees about the given axis, or get symmetry of given plane.

This should be the last action.

```python
wing.flip(axis='None', plane='None')
```

```text
axis:    turn 90 degrees about axis: +X, -X, +Y, -Y, +Z, -Z
plane:   get symmetry about plane: 'XY', 'YZ', 'ZX'
```

The *axis* and *plane* can be a single string, or a string contains multiple actions to take in order, e.g., '+X  +Y'.



#### bend

Bend surfaces by a guide curve. The guide curve is defined by *leader*, i.e., a list of points defining a spline curve. Then, regenerate the surfaces between section *isec0* and *isec1*.

```python
wing.bend(isec0: int, isec1: int, leader=None, kx=None, ky=None, rot_x=False)
```

```text
isec0:  the index of starting section
isec1:  the index of ending section
leader: list of points (and chord length) in the guide curve. [[x,y,z(,c)], [x,y,z(,c)]]
axis:   Z-axis, spanwise direction
kx:     X-axis slope (dx/dz) at both ends [kx0, kx1]
ky:     Y-axis slope (dy/dz) at both ends [ky0, ky1]
rot_x:  if True, rotate sections about x-axis to make the section vertical to the leader
```
